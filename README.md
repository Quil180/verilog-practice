# What is this?
This is my personal verilog practice github using the HDLBits tutorials. This is meant for my own reference, so that I can look back at what I did using verilog incase I forget anything or incase I wish to review in the future.

# How will this be organized?
I plan to organize this into multiple sub-folders (each having multiple subtopics), them being the following:
1. Verilog Language

    a. Basics

    b. Vectors

    c. Heirarchy

    d. Procedures

    e. Extra Verilog Features

2. Combinational Logic

    a. Basic Gates

    b. Multiplexers

    c. Arithmetic Circuits

    d. Karnaugh Map to Circuits

3. Sequential Logic

    a. Latches and Flip-Flops

    b. Counters

    c. Shift Registers

    d. More Circuits

    e. Finite State Machines

4. Larger Circuits

5. Reading Simulations

    a. Finding bugs in code

    b. building a circuit from a simulation waveform

6. Writing Testbenches
